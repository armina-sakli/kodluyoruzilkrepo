        <p>Hi, i am Armina. Computers have always fascinated me. Playing with them was my passion. I noticed this while playing the game. computers were created with their own codes and that's how we played the games. Why shouldn't I make my own game? now I took the first step and started with the front-end. I would like to thank Patika for contributing to this.</p>
